There are countless apps where users can upload and listen to music. MoodyTunes 
is different because it generates playlists baseed on user's mood. This app utilizes 
a Spotify API for song snippets. Each playlist has reaction upvotes which endorses 
that playlist's mood.

## Technology
This app is built on a MERN tech stack. It uses MongoDB as the datavase for Node.js 
and Express.js on the backend, and Javascript/React/Redux to render the front-end.
